    "# Python Libraries\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of Python is the ability to extend the baseline functionality with libraries. The library is a collection of methods that are often surrounding a particular feature or objective. There are libraries for mathematical functions `math`, scientific python `scipy`, dataframe libraries `pandas`, numerical handling and matrices `numpy`, plotting libraries for creating graphs `matplotlib` and other specialized libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain use of a library it must first be installed. Python has several ways to install a library but the most comom is the `pip install` command followed by the library name. This action only needs to be performed once and your code environment will have access to those methods."

    "The pip is an acronym for Python Install Packages. When combined with the install command it will install the library called directly following. For instance, to install the math library named `math`, we would type `pip install math` and execute the cell. Python will find the module for the installer and begin unpacking the files, installing the library contents, and makes them available for use. It is important to note, the pip install should be run in a cell alone and without markup. The markup causes the pip install to fail and combining multiple pip installs can be okay but you will miss some of the essential messages at the end when it rapidly moves on to the next install.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay attention to the information it states at the end of the install. Some libraries require you to restart your kernel before the packages are available for use. In most IDEs you would select Runtime from the file menu and select Restart Kernel. When you choose to restart the kernel any variables and their values will be discarded so those cells would need to be run again. Typically we install all the libraries in a separate notebook so that our working notebook is not cluttered with the installer data.\n",

    "The advanced libraries allow a user to manipulate the scaling, isolate specific variables, change the axes, manipulate the colors, and even generate three dimensional plots the user can spin around in many different directions to see insights that may have been hidden when the data was flattened. While these sound amazing (and they are) a data scientist must consider the size of their data and how much computing power it takes to generate those plots. We call this **Computational Cost** which factors in how powerful the computer must be to make the plots, how much electricity it takes to churn through the data to create them, and how much power the user needs in their device to see the visualization. There are many more visualization libraries to choose from and more created every month. A few more to investigate for very advanced plots are:\n",

The charts are rendered in the coding environment and features an exploded view, where clicking on a specific data point, bar, or pie slice will expand the data to the full chart window allowing deeper insights into data. The user can draw a box around data points and isolate a region in the graph in the exploded view to investigate outliers. The three dimensional plots spin on axis and can be rotated through the x, y, and z axis so that the data can be seen in any angle.\n",
    "* *Flourish*, this is a rising data science library that adds functionality through new graph types almost weekly. It is not unheard of to be working in Flourish and have a new chart type added while you are working. This library combines the features of seaborn, plotly, and bokeh with an open-source feel. This means if you program a new chart type you can add it to the library for other developers to use. Because of the open-source feel it is expanding rapidly and often features hybrid plots that would not have been previously used.\n",
    "* *d3js*, this is just as you imagine, a javascript based python library that features everything Bokeh and plotly offer but runs faster and smoother with extremely large (+10mil data points) data that is also wide data (wide data features greater than 100 columns wide with many rows of data values)."

    "Some libraries are very large and contain alot of methods which begin to take up some of your memory when you load them. It is possible to import just the module that you need from a library rather than the entire library. This is especially true if you only need one method in the library. In this case you use the Python keyword `from` to designate the library followed by the `import` method to state which method you want to load from the specified library."
