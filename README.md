Introduction to Data Science
## Welcome to the DATA-200 Introduction to Data Science Course
Welcome, Howard University Scholars!

Welcome to the DATA-200 Intro to Data Science course. 

This course introduces the what, why, and how of Data Science. This course will enhance your knowledge of exploration, processing, and transformation to gain meaningful insights from large amounts of data. The Intro to Data Science course is an introductory course. You will mainly learn from lectures and hands-on coding experiences with Python. You must have foundational Python experience, as this course will not teach beginning Python and will rely on existing Python knowledge. Your success in this course will be negatively impacted if you do not have previous Python experience or have not yet taken Foundational Python. Please refer to the Graduate School Handbook, Section 4: Grades and Academic Performance, for more information on satisfactory academic performance for the Howard University Graduate School. 

I am LaKeta Kemp, and I am very excited to be your instructor for this course. The Syllabus, Discussions, and Modules tabs are good places to start during the first week of class. Please also review the content in the Learner Support Tab. Please post your initial response to the discussion board's introduction activity by August 26, 2024, and reply to two peers by September 03, 2024. 

To succeed in this course, please check your Howard email daily and log into the course daily. 

Best, 

Prof. LaKeta

## Course Description:
Students will delve into the current data science landscape, exploring its theories, tools, and practical applications. This course aims to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of data science and empower them to apply its skills effectively in comprehending the complexities of our world. Through the art of storytelling, data visualization, data cleaning, statistical analysis, and the development of practical products and tools, students will gain valuable insights from the practical application of data science. By the end of this course, students will possess the knowledge and proficiency to unravel meaningful patterns and trends and to derive valuable insights from data to inform decision-making.

## Course Objectives: 
Upon successfully completing the course, learners will be able to:

* Define Data Science, the data science process, and exploratory data analysis.
* Apply exploratory data analysis and the data science process across
* Identify industry best practices for the application of each technique.
* Formulate a research question, source data to support the research question, and perform cleaning required for an analysis of the data.
* Utilize data science tools for curating and analyzing data to share and communicate insights into
* Create effective visualization of given data (to communicate or persuade) for data storytelling.
* Identify and reason the ethical and privacy issues in data science and apply ethical practices.

## Prerequisite(s): 
Foundation in Python and statistics. Students will learn from lectures and hands-on coding experiences with Python. You must have foundational Python experience, as this course will not teach beginning Python and will rely on existing Python knowledge. Your success in this course will be negatively impacted if you do not have previous Python experience or have not yet taken Foundational Python. Please refer to the Graduate School Handbook, Section 4: Grades and Academic Performance, for more information on satisfactory academic performance for the Howard University Graduate School.
